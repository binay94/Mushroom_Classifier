# Mushroom Classifier

## Problem Statement:
The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms contains descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family Mushroom (1981). Each species is labelled as either definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or maybe edible but not recommended. This last category was merged with the toxic category. The Guide asserts unequivocally that there is no simple rule for judging a mushroom's edibility, such as "leaflets three, leave it be" for Poisonous Oak and Ivy.The main goal is to predict which mushroom is poisonous & which is edible.

Dataset: <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/mushroom-classification>

## Project Stages

### 1. Data Exploration:
  - Understand the dataset by analyzing its structure, patterns, and potential issues.
  - Identify anomalies and missing data that might affect model performance.

### 2. Data Cleaning:
  - Preprocess the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies.
  - Ensure the data is in the right format for modeling.

### 3. Feature Engineering:
  - Select, transform, or create features that enhance credit default prediction.
  - Use domain knowledge and data analysis to extract valuable information.

### 4. Model Building:
  - Experiment with various machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, random forests, and support vector machines.
  - Identify the most suitable model for credit default prediction.

### 5. Model Testing:
  - Evaluate model performance using relevant metrics to ensure accurate predictions.

### 6. Deployment:
  - Deploy the chosen model to a production environment, leveraging cloud platforms like AWS Elastic Beanstalk or EC2.
  - Create an API for users to input data and receive credit default predictions.

## Requirements

Before you begin, make sure you have the following requirements:

- Python 3.8 or later installed in your computer <https://www.python.org/downloads/>

## Setup and Usage

    1. **Clone the repository**:

        git clone <https://github.com/binay94/Mushroom_Classifier>

        cd your-repo-name

    2. Create a virtual Environment:

        conda create -p "environment name" python=3.8 -y

    3. Activate Virtual Environment:

        conda activate <Virtual Environment Path>

    4. Install the required packages:

        pip install -r requirements.txt

    5. Run the Flask application:

        python application.py

    6. Access the application:

        - Open your web browser and go to <http://localhost:5000> to interact with the app.

        - Fill in the required fields in the classification form. Enter the data inputs according to the descriptions and submit the form.

        - After submitting the form, you'll be directed to a page displaying the classification results. The predicted obesity classification will be shown.

## Results:
The objective of this project is to create a solution that effectively predicts the probability of a mushroom being poisonous or edible based on its characteristics. The success of the project will be evaluated by assessing the model's performance on test data, where it should exhibit a robust ability to classify instances as either poisonous or edible with high precision and recall.

The ultimate deliverables of the project will include a trained machine learning model and an API. This model can then be utilized to predict the probability of mushrooms being poisonous or edible for new samples or existing datasets.
